NAME

		mv â€” move files

SYNOPSIS

		mv [SOURCE] [DEST]
        mv [SOURCE] [DIRECTORY]

DESCRIPTION

		If the last argument names an existing directory, 'mv' moves the 
        other given file into a file with the same name in that directory. 
        Otherwise, if only two files are given, it renames the first as 
        the second. 

EXAMPLE

        mv a1.txt a2.txt
            renames a1.txt to a2.txt
        
        mv a1.txt c:/
            moves a1.txt to c:/
